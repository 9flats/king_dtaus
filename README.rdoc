= Dtaus

DTAUS is a format for german bank transfers and is short for 
"Datentr√§geraustausch". The format itself totally sucks because it was 
established in the last century, to be used on floppy disks. Still almost 
all german banks use it(they only seem innovative at robbing), and it is 
therefore supported in common banking programs too.

This gem saves you all the trouble when generating dtaus-text.
